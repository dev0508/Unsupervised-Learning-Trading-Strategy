# Unsupervised-Learning-Trading-Strategy

I am analyzing 8 years of data for all S&P 500 stocks, calculating various momentum metrics and betas for each stock and its respective date. I am clustering stocks based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and selecting the ones with higher momentum. I then apply an unsupervised machine learning model to the selected stocks to optimize portfolio allocation and maximize return for the portfolio for last 8 years.
