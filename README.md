# Unsupervised-Learning-Trading-Strategy
I am analyzing 8 years of data for all S&P 500 stocks, calculating various momentum metrics and betas for each stock at different time points. Iâ€™m specifically focusing on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and clustering stocks based on their RSI values. I then select the cluster with an RSI of 70 and apply a machine learning model to the selected stocks to optimize portfolio allocation and maximize returns.
